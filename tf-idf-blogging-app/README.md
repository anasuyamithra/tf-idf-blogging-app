# 📝 Tf-IDF Blog CMS with _search_ and _automated tagging_ 

```diff
+ Sample CMS built with MEN Stack
+ Automated Tagging added (stopwords for markdown not added)
+ Search functionality added (using document similarity implemented with cosine similarity)
```
Our new online publishing platform features a Content Management System (CMS) that is designed to enhance user engagement and overall user experience. With a focus on user retention, we have developed an intuitive platform that streamlines the article publishing process and enables admins to perform CRUD operations on their respective articles with ease.

Our NLP Text Pre-Processing Algorithm, TF-IDF, has been integrated into our platform to automate the process of categorizing articles under relevant topics/tags. This means that users can focus solely on creating their content, while our platform takes care of ensuring that the content is tagged accurately and appropriately.

Our search function has been designed with user convenience in mind. Our system uses cosine similarity to provide the top 4 articles that are most relevant to a user's search query. This feature allows users to search for articles using natural language, without having to worry about the specific keywords or tags associated with the article.

Overall, our online publishing platform provides an intuitive and streamlined experience for both users and admins, allowing for easy content creation, management, and discovery.
